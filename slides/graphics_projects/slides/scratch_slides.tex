\begin{outline}
\1 LBM fluid-solid coupling \cite{Lyu2021}
\1 Spectral method for Fluid simulation over curved domains \cite{Cui2021}
\1 Different TO method of strucs and cables \cite{Rowe2023}
  \2 Could be a pre-processor for trad TO
\1 Turbulence in mutli-fluid flows \cite{Li2024}
\1 Taichi based TO \cite{Liu2018}

\begin{frame}{Kinetic Models}
  \begin{outline}
\1 Cited for kinetic governing equation \cite{Shan2006}
  \2 Seems like general framework for deriving LBM methods
  \2 Eqn 5.7 maps to eq 1 in \cite{Lyu2021}
\1 They refer readers to \cite{Li2020} for LBM stuff
  \2 Their reference for LBM is more thorough, should follow that one first
  \2 Includes supplementary material \cite{Li2020Supplement}, found on \href{http://www.geometry.caltech.edu/pubs.html}{geometry.caltech}

  \begin{outline}
    \1 Found through guest article on 
    \href{https://feaforall.com/implementation-lattice-boltzmann-method-lbm/}{FEA for all}

    \1 Published several articles about LBM \cite{Maquignon2014}, \cite{Maquignon2022}

    \2 \cite{Maquignon2014} extends model from another paper I can't find.
      
    \2 Condensation models seems like a good periodic problem.

    \1 Was on this article, which seems to have a good overview of LBM and related articles. 
    About splitting problem across GPUs.
    Has references about data access patterns on GPU
    \cite{Duchateau2015}
