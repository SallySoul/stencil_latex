    \1 Found through guest article on 
    \href{https://feaforall.com/implementation-lattice-boltzmann-method-lbm/}{FEA for all}

    \1 Published several articles about LBM \cite{Maquignon2014}, \cite{Maquignon2022}

    \2 \cite{Maquignon2014} extends model from another paper I can't find.
      
    \2 Condensation models seems like a good periodic problem.

    \1 Was on this article, which seems to have a good overview of LBM and related articles. 
    About splitting problem across GPUs.
    Has references about data access patterns on GPU
