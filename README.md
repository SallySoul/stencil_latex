# Stencil Research

This is a collection of slides and documents written with latex
that I have been building as I work on my PhD.
A monorepo for these projects allows me to easily share
references and common components.

Every document lives in a separate directory with its own `main.tex` file.
Using the project directory as your working directory, build any document with
```
latexmk --pdf main.tex
```
