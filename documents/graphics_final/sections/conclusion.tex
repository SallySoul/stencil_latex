\section{Conclusion}

We have presented our LBM implementation, 
\lstinline{cm_lbm} and the background theory to 
explain its operation.
Though this project satisfies the goals laid out in my proposal,
it would require substantial work on solid-fluid-solid coupling 
and rendering before matching the state of the art.
Nonetheless, I feel that this has opened up 
several research avenues for me to pursue.
