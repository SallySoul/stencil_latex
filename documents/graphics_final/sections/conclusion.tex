\section{Conclusion}

I have presented our LBM implementation, 
\lstinline{cm_lbm}. I have explained the background theory to 
explain its operation, 
as well as how it relates to the latest research in this area.
I also outlined future work that would bring this project
closer to the true state of the art.
This project mostly satisfies the goals laid out in my proposal,
but came up short in a few areas, notably rendering and 
fluid solid coupling.
Nonetheless, I feel that this has opened up 
several research avenues for me to pursue.
