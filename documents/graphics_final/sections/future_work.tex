\section{Future Work}\label{sec:futurework}

\subsection{Zero-centered Storage}
Zero-centered storage extends the Galilean invariance of CM-MRT 
into the storage of our $f$ distributions.
It has been shown that $f_i$ don't deviate far from the reference
frame equilibrium.
By instead storing and operating on $\delta f = f - f_u$ 
we can greatly increase the numerical accuracy by better
utilizing the available bits of our floating point representation.
Zero-centered storage is thoroughly explained in \cite{Hennig2023}.

\subsection{Domain Decomposition}
Right now our solver only works on a single continuous allocation
for the entire domain.
Allowing the domain to be split over many blocks would have several 
advantages.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Utilizing Additional Memory } \\
My Macbook has a limit on storage buffer sizes of a little over $4$gb.
Domain decomposition would allow me to utilize more buffers, and thus more of the $64$gb I have available.

  \item \textit{Distributed Computing} \\
Distributing the solve over several compute nodes would require 
domain decomposition. 
This could be multiple GPUs in one system or
multiple compute nodes in an HPC environment.

  \item \text{Spatial Adaptivity} \\
Most exciting, domain decomposition would be the next step towards spatial adaptivity, see Figure \ref{fig:adaptivity}. 
Spatial adaptivity would allow the limited memory resources to
capture a greater amount of detail in turbulent flows.
\end{itemize}
