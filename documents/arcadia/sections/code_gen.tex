\section{Code Generation}

TODO: FeNICs

\subsection{Firedrake}

\begin{outline}
\1 (2017) ``Exposing and exploiting structure: optimal code generation for high-order finite element methods'' \cite{homolya2017exposing}
\2 Good ref for other FenIcs / FEM code gen papers
\2 Their focus is improving code gen for high order spectral elements I think
\end{outline}
