\section{Delaunay Triangulations}

\subsection{\textsc{InCircle} and \textsc{InSphere}}

\begin{align*}
  \text{\textsc{InSphere}}(a, b, c, d, p) &=
  \left|
  \begin{array}{ccccc}
    a_x & a_y & a_z & a_x^2 + a_y^2 + a_z^2 & 1 \\
    b_x & b_y & b_z & b_x^2 + b_y^2 + b_z^2 & 1 \\
    c_x & c_y & c_z & c_x^2 + c_y^2 + c_z^2 & 1 \\
    d_x & d_y & d_z & d_x^2 + d_y^2 + d_z^2 & 1 \\
    p_x & p_y & p_z & p_x^2 + p_y^2 + p_z^2 & 1 \\
  \end{array}
  \right|
\end{align*}



\subsection{Notes}
\begin{outline}
\1 ``Two Algorithms for Constructing a
Delaunay Triangulation'' \cite{lee1980two}
\2 Planar only, lots of good properties of the triangulation
\2 $O(N \log N)$ divide and conquer
\2 $O(N^2)$, iterative good average case, but mostly what I would expect, insert into enclosing triangle, update to preserve property
\2 Uses bins intead of space-filling curve

\1 ``Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations'' \cite{fortune2017voronoi}
\2 Mathy, works in $\mathbb{R^D}$
\2 Focus on relation convex hull.

\1 ``A Comparison of Five Implementations of 3D Delaunay Tessellation'' \cite{liu2005comparison}
\2 Practical comparison of incremental insertion Implementations
\2 Notes that at worst the number of tetrahedra is quadratic in the number of points, but in practice the number of tetrahedra is linear in the number of points
\2 Interesting discussion of the InSphere test

\1 ``Robust Adaptive Floating-Point Geometric Predicates'' \cite{shewchuk1996robust}
\2 I remeber this from Arepo paper \cite{Springel2010Pur}, presents techniques for creating exact and extended precision floating-point geometric predicates, and then demonstrates them on InSphere and Orient3D. 
\2 Does have a nice explanation for the LN compiler partially presented in the next paper that exact expression evaluation of integer predicates with known bit length 

\1 ``Efficient exact arithmetic for computational geometry'' \cite{fortune1993efficient}
\2 Presents floating point filter idea
\2 Sorta short, not sure I get it, but going off prev paper is better

\1 ``Adaptive Precision Floating-Point Arithmetic and Fast Robust Geometric Predicates'' \cite{richard1997adaptive}
\2 Longer version of \cite{shewchuk1996robust}

\1 ``Eï¬€icient Exact Geometric Predicates for Delaunay Triangulations'' \cite{devillers2003efficient}
\2 Loosing steam on this, but newer implementation, more filter layers, benchmarks favorably when compared to the famous predicates from \cite{shewchuk1996robust}.

\1 \textsc{AREPO} review \cite{Springel2010Pur}
\2 Use floating point predicates, track error
\2 evaluate with multiple precision integers from \textsc{GMP} if needed.

\1 Software side
\2 Rust \href{https://github.com/tczajka/bigint-benchmark-rs}{big int benchmarks}
\2 rug, wraps GMP, is best by far,
