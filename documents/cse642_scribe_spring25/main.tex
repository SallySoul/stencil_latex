\section{Introduction}

Today Rezaul continued to lead the discussion on their generalization of the strip-packing problem to 
include multiple colors.
Today's discussion focussed on the issue of approximating solutions.

The motivation for studying this problem is scheduling the runtime for $p$ programs using a limited amount of shared memory, $M$.
We assume that each program is specified as a set of blocks with a fixed width (memory requirement) and height (runtime requirement). 
Additionally, we have the constraint that each program cannot use  more than $\alpha M$ memory at a given point in time where $\alpha \in [1 /p, 1)$.
The goal is optimize the completion time for all programs.

In the case where $p = 1$, this reduces to the strip-packing problem, see the following example \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:BL_Example2.pdf}{from wikipedia}.

\section{Multi-color Strip Packing}

The hardness of this problem follows from strip-packing, when $p = 1$, and in turn bin packing which is NP-Hard.
Last week Lucas showed how to prove the hardness using partitions.

Also, last week we started working on an approximation algorithm
We'll consider two special cases.
\begin{enumerate}
\item There are only 2 programs
\item There are $p$ programs but each includes one task or program
\end{enumerate}

We can prove hardness since when $p = 1$, we have basic strip packing problem
which has been proven to be hard. Last week we considered special case 1.

Lucas said if we had $k$ colors, its trivial to have a $k$-times best approximation.
The idea is to use a bin-packing approximation for one program at a time,
restricted to $\alpha M$ memory, and then stack their solutions.
If the bin-packing approximation has an approximation factor of $A$, then we would 
have a $kA + \epsilon$ approxmation for the multi-color strip-packing problem.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Mayank pointed out this analysis is for completion opt, 
might be stronger for makespan opt?

 \item Rezaul pointed out, why not bin pack all rectangles into $\alpha M$ space?
\end{itemize}

There was some discussion about the exact value of this approximation.
If the first program has  $A \text{Opt}$, second is $2 A \text{Opt}$,
we would get $\frac{k (k +1 )}{2} A \text{Opt}$ in total?

How to do better:
\begin{itemize}
  \item What about shelfing? 
  \item Sorting rectangles some how?
\end{itemize}

Without the $M$ constraint, we can sort rectangles by completion time and doing smaller jobs first will yield optimal completion time. I.e. reduce to $1D$ case.

Another angle discussed was what if all rectangles have the same width? 
When all widths are the same, but not equal to $M$, we could sort the rectangles in non-decreasing order of height
Start arranging left to right and bottom to top.
Undecided if this would be optimial, but it is a natural generalization of the $1D$ problem.
